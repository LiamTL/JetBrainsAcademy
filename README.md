# JetBrainsAcademy

How I found out about JetBrains Academy:
A friend of mine told me about it when I was stuck with some coding problems(I'll spare you the details).
After Day 1, I was so interested in it! I was shown many ways on how to do things and reinforced some of my prev learning!
I will post a project every 2 - 4 days(Depending on my agenda). I will try my best to post all or nearly all projects!(*Voice in background: Gotta Learn 'em all!*)
