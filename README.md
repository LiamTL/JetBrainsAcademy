# JetBrainsAcademy

How I found out about it:
A friend of mine told me about it when I was stuck with some problems (I'll spare you the details).
After Day 1, I was quite moved (and *grooved*)! I was shown many ways on how to do things I previously knew and reinforced some of my learning!.
I will post a project every 2 - 4 days(Depending on my schedule). I will try my best to post all or most of the projects!(*Voice in background: Gotta Learn 'em all!*)
